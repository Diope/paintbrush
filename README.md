# Paintbrush

A work in progress. A small paint app made with React/Redux.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

run `docker-compose up` to run in development mode and point your browser to `localhost:3000`

Currently all that is available is the ability to draw with a single predefined color and a predefined stroke.
